# recursive_links

recursive links are links which open in-line, and help reduce context switching. They are recursive because if that rlink has another rlink inside of it, it allows you to continue opening rlinks until you get to an rlink that contains no rlinks.

As previously mentioned, rlinks were created because when you click on a link on a website the default behavior is that you will move to the new page or id tagged element. When this occurs a context switch occurs where the content you were currently looking at disappears, meaning that you have to go back to see it, which in turn hides the other content.
